How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduce?

There are many lines of code that would be too hard to go over. Using the command line to compare two codes helps a lot with this. Finding the small differences in the code lines to help me narrow down the what could be the problem.

When I tried to download one of the files my computer kept calling it corrupt and deleting it.


Being able to access the entire history of my code will help me become a better programmer by giving me the freedom to try new things without worrying about completly ruining my code. If it doesn't work I can just go back to the old.


With manual commits, I like that I can choose what saves. It allows me to understand clear differences between the pages I created. I fear that if I had it automatically save I wouldn't be able to follow what is going on.

Git allows you to save multiple files in one commit because often code is seperated amongst pages. Google Docs is usally a single file anyway.

It is easy to compare to different commits using Git Bash. Log to bring up all the commits and diff to see the difference.

*The clone did not have all the files I needed*

Using version control I can be confident that if I mess something up in my code that I can go back to an older version. I can also find out if it is the code I add or if it was just a simple mistake on my part.

I am excited to use git to compare older versions and have the ability to feel free while writing code.
