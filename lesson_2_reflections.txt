What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository nothing phyisically happens to my file, it just sets up the directory to be ready to take commits. This is the very beginning of what I need to do to be able to use version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area gives me a location with the hidden files. It allows me to work on past commits.

The working directory is just a place to keep all the folders and to save files manually over time.
