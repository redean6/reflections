When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Using a remote repository helps me move from different computers, or if there is a team of us working on one file. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  For the same reason that git doesn't save periodically. I want to be in control of what is saved and when so that I still have a good idea about what is going on. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are copying commits and files through git hub. I would use it when I want to make changes to a file, but I don't want them to change the original users. 
Clones copy commits, but they don't give credit where credit is due. 
Branches are for me when I make changes to my own work. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  The ability to work from it offline.
